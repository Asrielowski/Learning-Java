        /*
         * CREATE A SIMPLE TRIVIA GAME
         *
         * Define (at least) three questions with three answers.
         * Prompt the User the type in their answer using the Scanner, you've seen in the output/input video
         * Then use if/else statements to check if the answer from the user is correct! And output that they were.
         * If they were wrong, tell the user and output the correct answer.
         *
         * BONUS: increment a points total each time the user is correct and at the end make a unique output for each
         * score the user might have (0 to 3)
         *
         * IMPORTANT TIPS:
         * 1. When reading in Strings from the user use scanner.next() (NOT scanner.nextLine())
         * 2. When you have an answer and input that are both strings you will have to use:
         *    userInput.equals(answer) instead of userInput == answer
